# 👋 Hi, I'm Jiahao Zhang (张甲豪)

🎓 Research Assistant @ HKUST (Guangzhou)  
🔬 Focus: Multimodal Large Models, Cross-modal Retrieval, Video-Audio Understanding

---

## 🧠 Current Research

My recent work focuses on:

- 🔁 **Cross-modal retrieval** using Cauchy-Schwarz divergence (CS/GCS)
- 🎥 **Video-audio-text understanding** with spatiotemporal graphs
- 🔍 **Fine-grained multimodal alignment** and contrastive learning
- 🧩 **Causal reasoning and storyline modeling** in long videos
- 🧠 Integration of large vision-language models like **Qwen-VL 32B**

I aim to build more interpretable, generalizable, and scalable solutions for multimodal representation learning.
